# Auto-Generate-Readme

## Project Description:
For this project I was tasked with taking some starter files, and filling them with code that would allow me to answer a series of questions through the terminal, and have the program generate a readme.md using my input.

## Project completion:
In order to achieve this I utilized the npm inquirer package, to allow the user to interact with the terminal. I implemented multiple files, all either requiring, or exporting data, in order to better organize the code in a readable manner. Followed by multiple functions to either initialize the program, or utilize the input data using template literals to generate the readme.md
